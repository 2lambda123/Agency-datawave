**NOTE:**

The DataWave 2.1.0 release has yet to be tagged. For now, this post is intended to demonstrate the release docs and
procedures for updating the site.

The source file for this post is **{{ page.path }}**

Note that the *frontmatter* section of this file sets **draft: true**

If you set **draft: false** or remove the **draft** property altogether, then links to this post will magically show up
in the news feed, in the release archive, and also on the home page in the "Latest News" panel. The "draft release notes"
warning at the top of this post will also go away

As with other page types in this site, page layout and other default properties for 'release'
posts are managed in **_config.yml**
